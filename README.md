# Unity VR Logger Files


Some Files to log where a person is looking in VR

Create an empty gameObject and attach PlayerTracker.cs. Drag Camera, left hand and right hand from your player controller. Logger.cs is a class, so leave that in your scripts folder.
Saves tracking files locally as a .csv. I then upload these to a server.

Tested and working with Oculus intergration.
